### What I learned

The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.

```js
fetch(url)

    .then(response => response.json() )

    .then(data => {

        getData(data);
            
    })

    .catch(err => console.log(err))  
}
```

If you want more help with fetch() method, we'd recommend checking out [Using the Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) to learn more.
